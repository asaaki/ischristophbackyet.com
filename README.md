_Or: How to present a single word in the most convoluted way possible_

</div><br />

I am on a short sabbatical from September to November 2020.

I just want to let my coworkers and friends know if I'm back* yet.

But also as an excuse to try Cloudflare's Workers Site.

_Bonus Points:_

* `TypeScript`

  Mixes general Sites template (`JS` only) with the regular `TS` template
  while making both wrangler and webpack happy about such changes.

* [TODO] Rust/WebAssembly based worker - is that possible for Sites already?
